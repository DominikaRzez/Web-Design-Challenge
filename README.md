<h1>Web-Design-Challenge</h1>
<p>The following repository contains the visualisation dashboard website of the weather data.
The landing page can be found <a href="https://dominikarzez.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/landing_page.html" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>. 
This is the main page containing project summary and links to each visualisation page.
<br>
<ul>The website consists of 7 pages:
<li>landing page</li>
<li>4 visualisation pages</li>
<li>comparison page - storing all of the visualisations</li>
<li>data page - displaying a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations</li>
</ul>
<br>
At the top of every page is a navigation menu. Specific buttons within the navbar allow users to come back to the landing page, open the dropdown with links to each visualisation and redirect to comparison and data pages. Further more the menu is responsive and converts into a collapsible navbar when the screen narrows.
<br>
The website was build using html, CSS, bootstrap and media queries to ensure its responsiveness.
